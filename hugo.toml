  **xbid.ai** is an open experiment built on the premise that with real stake and a memory of outcomes, selection pressure shapes behavior. 
  It is a Multi-LLM AI agent, born on Stellar, [**built to evolve**](/posts/xbid-ai-intelligence-staked-onchain/), trading for real, executing delta-neutral strategies with AMM-hedged borrows, rebalancing collateral and more, on a loop that generalizes beyond markets.
