bio_full = """Founder and developer at [LITEMINT](https://litemint.com) and [XBID LABS](https://xbid.ai). C++ is my native language. I never stopped exploring beyond it.  
&nbsp;  
I started out in tech as a C++ developer at [LCL Bank](https://www.lcl.fr/) in Paris, moved to London to work on smartcard systems for the UK government's National Programme for IT, and later served as Tech Lead at [BGC Group](https://www.bgcg.com/) in London with occasional projects in New York. After a few years in finance, I left to make games full time. I released 14 titles, earned an Honorable Mention at the 2014 Linux & Samsung Tizen App Challenge, and co-founded the Israel-based studio Massive Games before creating LITEMINT in 2018 and XBID LABS more recently.  
&nbsp;  
My journey into programming was atypical. I studied French literature and Latin at the University of Angers in France before teaching myself C++ after buying my first computer (still the best investment I ever made). For me, coding has always been a form of writing; a way to express meaning.  
&nbsp;  
I was born in Korea and live here now, after years spent across several countries. Baudelaire's [_Le Voyage_](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6099) is among my favorite poems. He wrote that true voyagers leave simply to leave; a paradoxical tautology I've always loved—in C++ poetry: `std::invoke([] { std::exit(0); return true; })`  
&nbsp;  
Outside of work, I paint, I game, and I keep learning. Martial arts have been part of my life since childhood, with Taekwondo grounding me the most. Learn something, build something, Love above all, repeat.
